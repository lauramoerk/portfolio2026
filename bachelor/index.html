          Digital frontline platforms are often designed around the frontline employee experience, while the administrative roles responsible for keeping these platforms running receive far less attention. This bachelor project explores that gap through a B2B SaaS case, focusing on workplace managers who handle support, user management, and ongoing platform maintenance.
<br><br>
          Through qualitative interviews and desk research, the study highlights a fragmented support journey and a high volume of repetitive, manual tasks that push workplace managers into “survival mode” rather than enabling strategic optimisation. As a result, time is taken away from activities that drive real value, such as improving engagement, content quality, and platform development.
          <br><br>
          The project proposes a conceptual solution based on AI-supported support and approval-based automation. The concept consists of three connected components: a data quality monitoring layer that detects inconsistencies across systems, an AI-supported support flow inside the app that structures and routes requests, and an Admin Support Center that provides clear, contextualised cases and human-in-the-loop automation suggestions. Together, the solution aims to reduce operational workload, improve efficiency and data quality, and create better conditions for strategic, value-creating work.
